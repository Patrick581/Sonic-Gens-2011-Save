## How to Use my Sonic Generations (2011) Save File

### Step 1: Find Your Save File Folder

Your save files are usually located at:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<Your Steam User ID>\71340\remote
```

Replace `<Your Steam User ID>` with your Steam account number. Inside this folder, you’ll see files named:

* `sonic.sav`
* `sonic2.dat`

---

### Step 2: Back Up Your Current Save Files

Before you replace anything, make sure to back up your existing save:

* Copy both `sonic.sav` and `sonic2.dat` from the folder to another safe place on your computer.

---

### Step 3: Replace the Save Files

* Get the save files you want to use.
* Rename them to `sonic.sav` and `sonic2.dat` (if they aren’t already named that).
* Paste them into the `remote` folder, overwriting the existing files.

---

### Step 4: Turn Off Steam Cloud Sync

To avoid Steam overwriting your replaced save files:

* Open Steam and go to your Library.
* Right-click on *Sonic Generations* and select **Properties**.
* Go to the **Updates** tab.
* Uncheck **Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for Sonic Generations**.

---

### Step 5: Launch the Game and Check

Start *Sonic Generations* and make sure your new save file is working properly.
