To use my save file in the 2011 PC version of *Sonic Generations*, follow these steps:

### üóÇÔ∏è Step 1: Locate Your Save File Directory

Your save files are typically stored in:([gamefaqs.gamespot.com][1])

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<Your Steam User ID>\71340\remote
```



Replace `<Your Steam User ID>` with your unique Steam user ID number. Within this folder, you'll find:([savegame.pro][2])

* `sonic.sav`
* `sonic2.dat`([steamcommunity.com][3], [reddit.com][4])

These files contain your game progress and settings.&#x20;

### üîÑ Step 2: Backup Your Current Save Files

Before replacing any files, it's essential to back up your current save data:([pcgamingwiki.com][5])

1. Navigate to the `remote` folder mentioned above.
2. Copy `sonic.sav` and `sonic2.dat` to a safe location on your computer.([steamcommunity.com][3])

### üì• Step 3: Replace with the New Save File

1. Obtain the save file you wish to use.
2. Rename the downloaded file to `sonic.sav`.
3. Place the renamed file into the `remote` folder, replacing the existing `sonic.sav`.([steamcommunity.com][3])

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Disable Steam Cloud Synchronization

To prevent Steam from overwriting your new save file:([reddit.com][4])

1. Open the Steam client.
2. Go to your Library and right-click on *Sonic Generations*.
3. Select **Properties**.
4. Navigate to the **Updates** tab.
5. Uncheck **Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for Sonic Generations**.([gamebanana.com][6], [gamefaqs.gamespot.com][7])

This ensures that Steam does not sync your save data and overwrite the changes.&#x20;

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Use SonicGMI for Mod Support

If you're using mods or facing issues with save file redirection:([gamebanana.com][8])

1. Download and install **SonicGMI** (Sonic Generations Mod Installer).
2. Launch SonicGMI and go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Uncheck **Enable save file redirection**.
4. Restart SonicGMI and then launch *Sonic Generations*.([steamcommunity.com][9], [steamcommunity.com][3])

This approach helps in scenarios where the game doesn't recognize the new save file. ([steamcommunity.com][3])
